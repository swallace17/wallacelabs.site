      <description>I run my home network on Ubiquiti UniFi based hardware utilizing a UniFi Dream Machine Pro (UDMP) as my gateway/firewall, along with an assortment of UniFi Access Points (APs) and managed switches. In the event that I need to remote into my network, my gateway operates an L2TP over IPsec VPN. Using the built in Radius server, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to configure this VPN so that remote clients are automatically routed to a specific subnet via a VLAN tag.</description>

      <description>It seems appropriate that my first post on this site be an exploration of its own technical underpinnings. That being said, before I get too far into the weeds, a bit of context. When I set out to build my site I had a few goals in mind. Those goals can be reasonably summarized as wanting to build a site from markdown files in Github, and self-host it using docker containers.</description>
